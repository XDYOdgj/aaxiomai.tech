I had been making homemade kraut (with beets and carrots) for several years and making it in a gallon jar with plastic bags and rocks to seal it. This is so much easier to use and I can make smaller batches now that I am living alone. And the results are delicious. Many stores now carry raw fermented veggies but why not make your own custom organic fermented veggies at a fraction of the price? Many people I know do not like fermented veggies but there are great recipes online to use fermented veggies. A friend gave me a recipe for sauerkraut salad using olives, chopped celery, onions, oil, vinegar, and sugar (I use stevia). My brothers who hate sauerkraut loved this.",

If you purchase the pieces that make up this set it comes out pretty good. I've made kraut and have a jar of red onions fermenting at this time. The process is simple: just put your veggies in, add the brine, make sure all your material is completely covered by the brine and wait. You may want to experiment with the salt water ratio (something I am nervous to do being a novice). My kraut tasted a bit salty so next time I will use less salt and see what happens. The most difficult task is making sure the vegetables are beneath the brine liquid. This inhibits any mold from forming. The way I've done it thus far is to top off my kraut with a large leaf of cabbage. This leaf will push down on the smaller shreds and keep them below. I've actually eaten the top leaf (out of curiosity) since there was no mold on it; tasted like a big leaf of sour sauerkraut. The system seems to truly inhibit mold since it forces the oxygen out of the jar. For onions I simply used one of the waste ends and used that to top and push the material down. I've tried (with success), placing a small baggy filled with brine on top. This worked fine but is difficult when using a normal jar. With a 1/2 gallon it should work just fine. My next purchase may be the weights that are glass or ceramic. Overall a simple and fun way to introduce yourself to fermentation. You just have to have patience!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-03-17 16:54:37"},{"user":"G. Hearn","content":"I liked this item so much. . . I purchased a second set!Having said that, there are a few \u201cissues\u201d.First of all, I\u2019m VERY new to fermenting.It can be a bit \u201cconfusing\u201d in the beginning.Like with a lot of recipes, some people say do it this way. . . .some people say do it that way.I think you simply have to try different options / recipes and find out what you like best and what works for you.But this \u201ctopper\u201d certainly is a GREAT start on your adventure to fermenting.These \u201ctoppers\u201d keep the oxygen out, which is a very good thing.Though \u201ctoppers\u201d  are not required to ferment something, it makes it safer.If oxygen gets to your veggies, then it can cause spoilage.There are very few recipes included.There\u2019s some additional information on their website.But you\u2019re going to have to do some looking around on your own.There are lots of online resources and recipes, as well as lots of books.But in the end. ..for the most part. . . you simply take whatever veggies you want to ferment. . . add a mixture of salt and water. . . and either days. . . or weeks later (all depending upon what you\u2019re fermenting, and your preferences). . . you have delicious fermented veggies.FYI. . . When some people hear the word \u201cfermented\u2019 it doesn\u2019t sound good.But \u201cfermenting\u201d is a form of \u201cpickling\u201d.Most people think of pickles with vinegar, but \u201cfermenting\u201d uses saltwater.FYI:Sauerkraut is a fermented vegetable.But here are the \u201cissues\u201d. . . .

Not very good with the whole \"burping\" and \"submerging the veggies under water\" ordeals. Always found it to be a hassle.But this has made it super easy for me (don't really even have to submerge the veggies under water). I just chop them up, smash them a little to release the juices, put them in the jars with a little water, and put these gaskets on them. Then I ignore for about 7-9 days, and viola! The veggies are done and taste delicious! No failures since using these!When I'm done using them I just wash them briefly with a little soap and put them away till next time. I use these in conjunction with \"Mercola's Kinetic Culture\" to amplify the health benefits of my fermentations.Super easy to use, clean and makes fermenting a sure success.

They worked so slick that Iordered another 2 kits for myself. I have made six jars full of different fermented veggies. All worked terrific! No mold on top as I have experienced in past without this system. Now I always have some fermented veggies ready in the fridge and some fermenting in a cool dry place.I did also purchase some Pickle Pebbles PLUS - Glass Fermentation Weights to keep the veggies under the water line. I am not sure this is necessary with this closed system but I wanted the extra assurance. Make sure you put a dish under the mason jar when they are beginning to ferment. If the fermentation process displaces the water content they will flow over - no problem, just open the jar and pour a little water off then reseal. Watch for the bubbles that surface so that you can see the fermentation in progress. I will buy more to give to my daughter as a Christmas gift. Good health is a gift of love.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2015-10-15 16:54:37"},{"user":"Casey Stewart","content":"We normally don't eat sauerkraut, but had a tasty Country Pork Rib and Sauerkraut, with a bit of brown sugar, and it wasn't half bad. The salt content of the packaged product was outrageous though, and we are both on low sodium diets due to high blood pressure. Searching about I did find a way to make our own using much less salt and research also showed the air-lock type set-up to be a good bit healthier than the standard crock or weighted down jar, due to the mold factor.This company quickly shipped out a couple of their universal lid setups, we purchased some quart and half gallon sized canning jars, and within a week or two had our own sauerkraut, much tastier than the canned stuff, much healthier and with the going rater of cabbage, pretty darned cheap. Next we will be pickling cauliflower, carrots, celery, onions and sweet red pepper to use in our own Italian Olive Salad!Very pleased with this product, ease of use, helpful communication with seller and more information found on the FARMcurious website.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-12-15 16:54:37"},{"user":"jjennifer","content":"This kit was really easy to use. My previous experience was in making kombucha. I just finished a batch of lacto-carrots. I see a lot of confusion regarding weights and I started out using freezer bags with distilled water. Now I use glass weights for wide mouth mason jar. the Gut friendly bacteria you can expect from your fermentation include: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. plantarum, L. caret, L. pentoaceticus, L brevis and L. Thermopolis. This is much easier than canning.The basic recipe for the brine is one tablespoon on salt (sea or Himalayan) to two cups of water. I just heat it up in the microwave enough to make it dissolve but not get really hot. You can pretty much add anything you want to flavor it (peppercorn, dill, garlic, etc) and set it up and leave it for 5 days min.

A friend introduced us to a certain brand of fermented salsas and we've developed a real liking to them, recently we've tried some of their other veggie mixtures and we like some of those too. They're so pricy we didn't buy them as often as would like to. Than I \"found\" theFarmcurious kit I'd purchased earlier and I decided to start using it.

Many stores now carry raw fermented veggies but why not make your own custom organic fermented veggies at a fraction of the price? Many people I know do not like fermented veggies but there are great recipes online to use fermented veggies.
